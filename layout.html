<h1>Paragraphs</h1>
	<img src="150px-Oregon_State_text_logo.svg.png" alt="img">
	<p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-
	having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me 
	on shore, I though I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
	It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
	Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a dam drizzly
	November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin
	warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially 
	whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
	principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and 
	methodically knocking people's hats off, I account it high time to get to sea
	as soon as I can.</p>
	<p>You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures
	of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he
	told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the 
	truth. That is nothin. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it
	was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly- Tom's Aunt Polly, she is - 
	and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true
	book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</p>
